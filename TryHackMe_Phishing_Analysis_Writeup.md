 TryHackMe - Phishing Analysis 
Overview
This write-up covers my completion of the Phishing Analysis room on TryHackMe, which walks through analyzing a phishing email to identify Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), malicious attachments, and infrastructure used in a phishing campaign. This room is beginner-friendly and a great way to learn about email header analysis, phishing tactics, and malware investigation.

# Objectives
Analyze a suspicious email and its headers

Identify phishing tactics

Extract IOCs such as URLs and IPs

Examine a malicious Excel file

Understand how phishing campaigns operate

 Task 1 - Introduction
No answers required ‚Äì a brief intro to phishing and the goals of this room.

Hosted on a VPS service commonly abused by attackers

Payload detected by multiple antivirus engines on VirusTotal

What is the IP address of the domain?
203.0.113.17

When was the domain registered?
Example: 2024-12-01
