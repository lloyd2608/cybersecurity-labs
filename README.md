The Unified Kill Chain room explains how cyber attackers operate through all stages of an attack. It combines the Cyber Kill Chain and MITRE ATT&CK frameworks into one complete model with 21 steps.

    ## Learning Objectives
Understand the Unified Kill Chain and its 3 main stages:

Initial Foothold

Network Propagation

Action on Objectives

Identify common techniques and tactics used by attackers

Apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios in threat detection and mitigation

    ## Key Concepts
 Stage 1: Initial Foothold
Target Selection

Reconnaissance

Weaponization

Delivery

Social Engineering

Exploitation

Installation

     ## Stage 2: Network Propagation
Command and Control

Internal Reconnaissance

Credential Access

Lateral Movement

Privilege Escalation

Persistence

    ## Stage 3: Action on Objectives

Collection

Exfiltration

Impact

Detection Evasion

Execution

Obfuscation

Anti-Forensics

     ## TryHackMe Lab Highlights

Learned how cyber attackers operate step-by-step in real-world scenarios

Understood how defensive measures can be mapped to each stage of the kill chain

Applied knowledge to answer practical questions in the room

## Tools and Techniques Explored

Open-source intelligence (OSINT)

Social engineering vectors

Exploitation techniques

Command-and-control communications

Detection and response strategies

üìù Conclusion
The Unified Kill Chain provides a comprehensive way to visualize and respond to modern cyber threats. Completing this room helped reinforce my understanding of how attacks unfold and how security teams can intervene at various stages.
