 # Cybersecurity Labs

Welcome to my personal **Cybersecurity Labs**  a journey-in-progress as I transition from a passionate learner to a skilled cybersecurity analyst. This repo is my open notebook: a collection of labs, notes, scripts, and small victories along the way.

##  My Mission

To **build real-world skills** in cybersecurity by learning hands-on:
- Investigating threats
- Writing basic tools
- Solving real challenges
- Breaking things (then fixing them)

I document everything I do here to keep myself accountable and maybe help others who are also just starting out.

##  Tools & Topics I'm Exploring

-  **Labs**: TryHackMe, Hack The Box, VulnHub
-  **Skills**: Network scanning, vulnerability analysis, enumeration, scripting
-  **Concepts**: Cyber Kill Chain, Pyramid of Pain, CIA Triad, defense evasion
-  **Languages**: Python, Bash, PowerShell
